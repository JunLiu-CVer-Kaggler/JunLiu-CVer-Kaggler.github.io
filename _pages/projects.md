**03/19 - Present   Algorithm Engineer at [PingAn Technology, Inc](https://tech.pingan.com/en/)**
- Benign and Malignant Classification of Breast Tumors in Ultrasound Images Based on MetaData and Textural Features.
- Built a CS backend software which is based on LabelMe and designed for labeling multi-modal images.

**09/17 - 03/19    Algorithm Engineer at [Imsight Medical Technology, Inc](http://www.imsightmed.com/article/en), work with [Dr. Hao Chen](http://appsrv.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~hchen/) and [Dr. Qi Dou](https://carrend.github.io/)**
- Algorithm Optimization works: optimize the speed and memory resource consumption for volumetric image analysis algorithms: Lung segmentation and Radiomics algorithms. I do extremely optimize the algorithms for 10 times faster and with almost 50% lower memory resource consumption.
- Applying state-of-the-art Fine-Grained related ideas to addressing tricky issues (Large Intra-Class Variance and Small Inter-Class Variance) in Attributes Classification (Benign&Malignant, Ground-Glass&Solidï¼†Calcification) of the pulmonary nodule.
- I designed an effective, fast and accurate algorithm which is implemented in c++11 to detect the same nodules in different series of follow-up images.
- Built a stable CS software called Lung-Sight which is a developed lung cancer screening system with the cutting-edge AI technologies. 

**07/17 - 09/17    Research Assistant  at [Institute of Biomedical and Health Engineering,  SIAT](http://english.siat.cas.cn/SI2017/IBHE2017/)**
- RMF based Vessel planar parameterization.

**09/16 - 11/16    Research Intern at Samsung Electronics (China)R&D Center**
- Scene Text Image Synthesis, Estimate Depth From Single RGB Image, Image Segmentation, Image Fusion, etc.

**05/16 - 09/16    Research Intern supervised by Dr. Shandong, Wang and [Dr. Yurong, Chen ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/intel-corporation/)    [Intel Labs China](https://www.linkedin.com/company/intel-corporation/)**
- 3D Human Face Reconstruction From Single 2D Image, Facial Expression Transfer, Face Frontalisation, etc.
