I'm currently working as an AI research scientist at [Infervision Technology, Inc.](https://global.infervision.com/), with previous experience as a Research Assistant at the [Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology](http://english.siat.cas.cn/) after earning my Master's Degree from [the School of Mathematical Sciences at Capital Normal University](http://math.cnu.edu.cn/) in June 2017. I've also interned at the Text Processing Lab of Samsung Electronics and the Cognitive Computing Lab of Intel. My research is focused on interdisciplinary applications of artificial intelligence in medical image analysis, with a particular emphasis on improving lesion detection, anatomical structure segmentation and quantification, and cancer diagnosis and therapy.
